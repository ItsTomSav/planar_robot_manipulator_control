# Control of a 2DOF Planar Robotic Manipulator

## 🎯 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and implementing different control strategies for a **2-DOF planar robotic manipulator** using MATLAB and Simulink.
The goal is to design, simulate, and validate **decentralized** and **centralized** control approaches for trajectory tracking in both joint and operational space.
